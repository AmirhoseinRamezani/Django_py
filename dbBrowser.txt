ORM
# One of the most powerful features of Django is the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that allows you to map SQL to your databases.
    In fact, Django's ORM is just a way to build and manipulate databases with the Python language at its core, without having to 
# Django provides us with an admin panel for our users.
    So, we don't have to worry about creating an admin page or providing an authentication feature because Django provides this feature for us.
    Before using this feature, you need to migrate your project.

superuser
    How to create a superuser in Django?
To create a superuser, first go to the same directory as manager.py and run the following command:
python manage.py createsuperuser
Then enter your desired username and press enter.
Then enter the email address and press enter. 
(You can leave it blank in the current situation but don’t do this in an official environment)
Next, enter the password in the Password field and press enter. Enter a strong password to keep it secure.
Then re-enter the same password for confirmation.
If the above fields are entered correctly, the Superuser is created successfully.

Now we can log in to our Django Admin page by running the command python manager.py runserver.
 Then,open a web browser and navigate to the “/admin/” field on your local domain – for example,
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and then enter the username and password.

The Django admin panel essentially provides a secure,
 production-ready admin interface that speeds up backend development while 
 maintaining enterprise-level security standards.




Django Meta Model - Technical Explanation
🏗️ Architecture Definition
A meta model is a built-in class in the Django ORM that implements a metadata template for model configuration. This class provides a declarative approach to defining model-level properties and behaviors without changing the implementation of the fields.

💻 Technical Syntax Structure
python
class Student(models.Model):
# Field definition (database schema)

name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
age = models.IntegerField()

# Meta class (model metadata)

class Meta:

# Configuration options

db_table = 'students_table'

ordering = ['name']
⚙️ Main Meta Options - Technical Specifications

🔹 abstract (Boolean)
Purpose: Implements the template method pattern for model inheritance

Effect: Creates an abstract base class (no database table)

Use: Shared field/method inheritance

python
class Meta:

abstract = True # No CREATE TABLE SQL generated

🔹 verbose_name & verbose_name_plural (String)
Purpose: Customize UI/UX layer for admin user interface

Effect: Overrides default model naming Admin Django

Python
Meta-class:
verbose_name = 'Student Entity'
verbose_name_plural = 'Student Entities' # Deprecate
🔹 app_label (string)
Purpose: Explicitly bind the application namespace
Effect: Resolves model-application relationships in the project structure

Python
Meta-class:
app_label = 'university_app' # Explicitly bind the application
🔹 sort (list/tuple)
Purpose: Default sort specification of QuerySet
Effect: Applies SQL ORDER BY clause to all model queries

Python
Meta-class:
ordering = ['-created_date', 'name'] # DESC date, ASC name
# SQL: ORDER BY created_date DESC, name ASC
🔹 db_table (string)
Purpose: Custom database table name
Effect: Overrides the default Django table naming convention

python
Meta-class:
db_table = 'tbl_students' # SQL table name Custom
🔹 Constraints (list)
Purpose: Database-level constraint definitions

Effect: Implement SQL CHECK constraints

python
Meta class:
constraints = [
models.CheckConstraint(
check=models.Q(age__gte=18) & models.Q(age__lte=65),
name='age_range_check'
)
]
🔹 indexes (list)
Purpose: Configure database index

Effect: Create SQL indexes for query optimization

python
Meta class:
indexes = [
models.Index(fields=['last_name', 'first_name']),
]
🔹 permissions (list of tuples)
Purpose: Custom permission system plugin

Effect: Adds to Django's authentication permission system

python
Meta class:
permissions = [
('can_export', 'can export student data'),
('can_audit', 'can audit student records'),
]
🔹 proxy (Boolean)
Purpose: Implements the proxy pattern for model inheritance
Effect: Creates a proxy model to modify behavior
Python
Meta class:
proxy = True # Same database table, different Python behavior
🔧 Technical implementation notes
Migration impact: Meta changes often require building migrations and migrations

Inheritance: Meta inherits from parent models (unless overridden)

Database support: Some options are database-specific

Performance: Options such as indexes and ordering affect query performance

🎯 Design pattern applications
Metadata pattern: Centralized configuration
Decorator pattern: Modifying behavior through options

Pattern method: Abstract base models

Proxy pattern: Runtime behavior modifications

The Model Meta class acts as a configuration interface between the Django ORM and the database layer It allows for customization of the declarative model while maintaining separation of concerns.

Django extensions 

You can get Django Extensions by using pip:

$ pip install django-extensions
If you want to install it from source, grab the git repository and install:

$ git clone git://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions.git
$ cd django-extensions
$ pip install .
Then you will need to add the django_extensions application to the INSTALLED_APPS setting of your Django project settings.py file.

This Django framework is used to create a sitemap in the form of an xml file. 
A sitemap is an XML file on your website that tells search engine crawlers how your pages are located on the server, 
how they change, and how "important" certain pages are compared to other pages on your site.
 This information helps search engines index your site.

 =======================================================================================================================================
 
 $ pip install django-taggit
Add "taggit" to your project’s INSTALLED_APPS setting.

Run ./manage.py migrate.
And then to any model you want tagging on do the following:

from django.db import models

from taggit.managers import TaggableManager

class Food(models.Model):
    # ... fields here

    tags = TaggableManager()
