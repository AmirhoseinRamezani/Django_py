ORM
# One of the most powerful features of Django is the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that allows you to map SQL to your databases.
    In fact, Django's ORM is just a way to build and manipulate databases with the Python language at its core, without having to 
# Django provides us with an admin panel for our users.
    So, we don't have to worry about creating an admin page or providing an authentication feature because Django provides this feature for us.
    Before using this feature, you need to migrate your project.

superuser
    How to create a superuser in Django?
To create a superuser, first go to the same directory as manager.py and run the following command:
python manage.py createsuperuser
Then enter your desired username and press enter.
Then enter the email address and press enter. 
(You can leave it blank in the current situation but don’t do this in an official environment)
Next, enter the password in the Password field and press enter. Enter a strong password to keep it secure.
Then re-enter the same password for confirmation.
If the above fields are entered correctly, the Superuser is created successfully.

Now we can log in to our Django Admin page by running the command python manager.py runserver.
 Then,open a web browser and navigate to the “/admin/” field on your local domain – for example,
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and then enter the username and password.
